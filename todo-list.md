# TODO List for app.py

- [ ] **Error Handling**: Add error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and display user-friendly error messages to users.

- [ ] **Logging**: Add more detailed logging throughout the application to track important events and diagnose issues effectively.

- [X] **Password Security**: Implement a password policy that enforces stronger password requirements (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).

- [ ] **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database queries and improve response time.

- [X] **Email Verification**: Add an option to resend the verification email if the user requests it.

- [ ] **User Profile Page**: Consider adding a user profile page where users can view and edit their own profile information.

- [ ] **Email Templates**: Utilize email templates to provide a consistent and professional look for verification and password reset emails.
